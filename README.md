## ***Summary***

In conclusion, the total reviews for vine program and non-vine program with over 10 total votes are 56 and 16275 respectively with an average star rating of 4.36 and 3.65, while vine program and non-vine program with over 10 helpful votes are 37 and 13,488. The analysis for vine reviews are limitless so there's a possibility of it being biased but with the analysis I performed it doesn't seem biased.
